# Policy Extraction Web App

[**Live App â†’**](https://chat-gemini-pro.streamlit.app/)

Policy Extractor is a tool built with Google's Gemini Pro, designed to help city planners and researchers automatically extract policies from municipal planning documents (e.g., CAPs, general plans). Gemini is a large language model that can be used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, translation, and question answering.

The tool processes PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files, page-by-page, using the Gemini API to identify key planning policies, particularly those related to zoning, evacuation, and fire resilience. Users can also filter or prompt the model for specific topics.
